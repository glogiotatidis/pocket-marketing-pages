              Please refer to the website you were visiting when you saved such

              We respect the intellectual property of others, and we ask our
              users to do the same. The Pocket Technologies allow you to
              time-shift across devices and platforms so that you can access
              information later that you had the right to access when you saved
              such content to Pocket. As a condition to your use of the Pocket
              Technologies, you agree not to use the Pocket Technologies to
              infringe any intellectual property rights. We reserve the right,
              at any time, in our sole discretion, with or without notice, to
              terminate the accounts of, and block access to the Pocket
              Technologies to, any users who infringe any copyrights or other
              intellectual property rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              We offer a paid subscription service (&quot;Pocket Premium&quot;)
              which, among other things, provides paid subscribers with certain
              features that are not made available to users of the standard,
              free version of the Pocket Technologies. Each paid subscriber has
              a separate, personal library in which an archival copy of saved
              content is stored for that subscriber’s own personal
              non-commercial use at a later time. The Pocket Premium
              subscription service also includes other features, such as
              full-text searching of saved content and suggested tags for an
              item. Subscriptions to Pocket Premium are available on monthly and
              yearly subscription plans.

              To initiate an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter
              requesting arbitration and describing your claim to: President,
              Mozilla Corporation/Pocket Business Unit, 2 Harrison Street, Suite
              175, San Francisco, CA 94105. Unless you and we agree otherwise,
              any arbitration will take place in the county (or parish) where
              you live. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS in accordance
              with that organization’s &quot;Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp;
              Procedures&quot; if JAMS has an office in the county (or parish)
              where the arbitration takes place. Otherwise, the arbitration will
              be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the
              American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules, including the AAA’s
              Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. JAMS rules
              and other information are available at https://www.jamsadr.com or
              by calling 800.352.5267. The AAA’s rules and other information are
              available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of
              all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by
              the applicable JAMS or AAA rules. We will promptly reimburse you
              for your payment of the filing fees, unless your claim is for
              greater than US$10,000, in which event you will be responsible for
              filing fees. If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that
              you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on
              the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a
              telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by
              the applicable JAMS or AAA rules. The arbitrator shall have the
              discretion to award reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs
              (including the cost of the arbitration and of experts) to the
              prevailing party, but we will only seek such fees if the
              arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.

            <h5 id="communication">ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS</h5>
            <p>
              If you create a user account or send emails to us, you consent to
              receive communications from us electronically. We will communicate
              with you by email or by posting notices on the Pocket
              Technologies. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures
              and other communications that we provide to you electronically
              satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in
              writing. You agree that we may send email to you for the purpose
              of advising you of changes or additions to the Pocket Technologies
              or your Pocket Premium subscription, about any of our products or

            <h5 id="revisions">REVISIONS TO AGREEMENT</h5>
            <p>
              We may, at any time, revise this Agreement. If we modify the Terms
              of Service, we will post the modification on our website, through
              the Pocket Technologies, or otherwise provide you with notice of
              the modification. Prior to each usage of the Pocket Technologies,
              you should review the Terms of Service to determine the current
              Agreement to which you are bound. For your convenience, we include
              the effective date of the Agreement at the beginning of the
              document, so that you can easily ascertain whether it has been
              updated since the last time you viewed the Terms of Service. Your
              continued use of the Pocket Technologies constitutes acceptance of
              this Agreement at the time of each use. If the modified Terms of
              Service are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease
              using the Pocket Technologies. Notwithstanding the preceding
              sentences of this paragraph, no revisions to the Terms of Service
              will apply to any dispute between you and Pocket that arose prior
              to the date of such revision. These Terms of Service may only be
              modified in writing as set forth in this paragraph, and may not be
              modified orally.
